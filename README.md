# GMeetLeaver
This is a simple extension that closes your meeting tabs (or any other tab if you want) at a specified time.

# How to Install
On a chromium based browser, clone this repo, and then you can install it by going to Extensions -> Load Unpacked. On some browsers you will have to enable a "Developer Mode" toggle on the extensions page.
